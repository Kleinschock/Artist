## What is Artist?
Artist is a training-free text-driven image stylization method. You give an image and input the prompt describing the desired style, Artist give you the stylized image in that style. The detail of the original image and the style you provide is harmonically integrated. 

**No** need to train, **no** need to download many ControNets or LoRAs. Just use a pretrained Stable Diffusion.

## Code Release
We promise to release the code (probably with a HuggingFace demo) no later than end of August.
